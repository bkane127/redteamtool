1. The goal of this tool is to keep track of what the blue team is doing, more importantly if the password is being changed. When the competition starts, the blue team will try to log the red team out of the box by chanigng the password and killing the redteams process. Once the keylogger shows the password being changed, the red team can get back into the machine. 
2. No other tools influenced this tool as the inspriation behind it was due to the fact that during the most recent competition, blue team only changed the passwords and red team was never in some of theboxes.
3. It is extremely feasible for another teammate to use this tool as it is very easy to inject.(described by the README file) As it is written in python, it is a very basic language that is self explanatory assuming the teammate would have previous python knowledge.
